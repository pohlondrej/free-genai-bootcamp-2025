## Homework Summary
I compared the following models:
- [Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model (free tier)](gemini/Readme.md)
- [DeepSeek-R1 14B distilled model running locally on Ollama](deepseek-r1-14b/Readme.md)
- [ChatGPT free tier with reasoning enabled](chatgpt-reasoning/Readme.md)
- [ChatGPT free tier with reasoning disabled](chatgpt-reasoning-disabled/Readme.md)

I treated the prompt like a game, and that worked for all models except DeepSeek.

I tried enriching the the answers by encouraging the AI to make the hints funny, and to rate my responses A-F.
