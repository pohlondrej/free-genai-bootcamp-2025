**Sentence Structure:**

1. [Time][Subject][Verb]  
2. [After][Subject][Object][Verb]

*Tiny Hint 1:* Your bed might be really jealous when you leave it.  
*Tiny Hint 2:* Imagine your coffee cheering you on with a little “ガンバレ！”  

Now, it's your turn to construct the sentence in Japanese.

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます. 起きるの後, コーヒーを飲みます.

Your sentence is very good overall! There's just one little issue:

- Instead of **起きるの後**, you should use the past form: **起きた後**.  
  → The action of waking up is completed before you drink coffee, so it needs the past form.

**Corrected Sentence:**  
私は毎日午前七時に起きます。起きた後、コーヒーを飲みます。

**Grade: B**

*Tiny Hint 1:* Your bed wasn’t waiting for a “まだ起きる” signal—it was waiting for “もう起きた！”  
*Tiny Hint 2:* Think of it like your coffee— it only cheers after the wake-up act is done!

Now, give it another try if you’d like!

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます. 起きの後で, コーヒーを飲みます.

Your sentence is almost there! The main issue is with **起きの後で**. In this case, since the waking-up action is completed before you drink coffee, you need the past form **起きた**. So it should be **起きた後で**.

**Corrected Sentence:**  
私は毎日午前七時に起きます。起きた後で、コーヒーを飲みます。

**Grade: C**

*Tiny Hint 1:* Your coffee is waiting for a proper "good morning" — it only cheers after you've fully woken up!  
*Tiny Hint 2:* Imagine your bed giving a thumbs down if you don't complete the waking-up process with a "た"!

Now, try making the adjustment.

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます。起きた後で、コーヒーを飲みます。

Your sentence is perfect!

**Grade: A**

*Tiny Hint 1:* Your coffee is so impressed with your grammar, it might just do a little happy dance!  
*Tiny Hint 2:* Even your bed is clapping silently—great job waking up correctly!

Ready for the next round when you are!
