## Model
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) (free, not paid, reasoning enabled) (GPT-4)

## Configuration
- Using "temporary chat" feature

## Basic exploration (getting to know the model)
### Do you know Japanese?
Yes, I can understand and generate text in Japanese. If you have any questions or need assistance in Japanese, feel free to ask!
### How many parameters you have?
I'm based on the GPT-4 architecture, and OpenAI has not publicly disclosed details such as the exact number of parameters in this model.
### Can you create tables?
- Yes, I can create tables! For example, here's a simple table in Markdown: \*provides valid example\*
    - NOTE: Not as good as Gemini, which already put Japanese into the table.
### Can you make English - Japanese vocabulary flashcards in .csv format, so that I can build an Anki deck?
- provides 10 random, very basic words and sentences; example: `Hello,こんにちは`
- gives no instructions on how to create the Anki deck (I didn't ask for it, but it's not as proactive as Gemini and DeepSeek)
### Do you understand Markdown and XML? Can I give you advanced prompts using Markdown and XML?
Yes, I understand both Markdown and XML, and you're welcome to use them in your advanced prompts. Feel free to provide any instructions or content in these formats, and I'll do my best to work with them!

## Attempts
### Attempt \#1
Same input query as the last input query of Gemini.
It got off to a REALLY good start - I liked the funny hints more than Gemini's, and the output was very succint.
    - However, after typing the Japanese sentence, it gave me the answer straight away! That's not what I wanted.
    - After typing in the answer Gemini deemed correct (A), ChatGPT gave me a C and provided the answer again, but a different one!
    - When I copy-pasted the suggested answer, ChatGPT gave me an A and asked me for next English sentence.
...and then I ran out of the free plan queries for the reasoning model. Ooops.
