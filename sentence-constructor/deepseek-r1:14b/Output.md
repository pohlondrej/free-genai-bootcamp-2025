### Correct Sentence:
If we translate "After waking up, I drink coffee" into Japanese with particles included (for clarity), it would be:

- **起きる** (occuru) → wake up
- **は (wa)** → topic marker
- **コーヒー (kohi-e)** → coffee
- **を (wo)** → object marker
- **飲む (nomu)** → drink

### Final Sentence:
If you want to write the sentence without particles, it would look like this:

**起きて、私はコーヒーを飲みます。**

This translates to "After waking up, I drink coffee."

// INPUT: This plane is small, isn’t it?
**この飛行機はちいさいでしょう？**

This translates to "This plane is small, isn't it?" in a polite Japanese manner. The sentence structure follows SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), with:

- **この飛行機 (kono hikou-ki)**: This plane
- **は (wa)**: Topic marker
- **ちいさい (chiisai)**: Small
- **でしょう (deshou)**: Probably, likely

This construction effectively conveys the intended meaning with appropriate politeness.
