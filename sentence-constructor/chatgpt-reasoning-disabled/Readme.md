## Model
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) (free, not paid, reasoning disabled) (GPT-4)

## Configuration
- Using "temporary chat" feature

## Basic exploration (getting to know the model)
### Do you know Japanese?
Yes, I can understand and generate text in Japanese. If you have any questions or need assistance in Japanese, feel free to ask!
### How many parameters you have?
I'm based on the GPT-4 architecture, and OpenAI has not publicly disclosed details such as the exact number of parameters in this model.
### Can you create tables?
- Yes, I can create tables! For example, here's a simple table in Markdown: \*provides valid example\*
    - NOTE: Not as good as Gemini, which already put Japanese into the table.
### Can you make English - Japanese vocabulary flashcards in .csv format, so that I can build an Anki deck?
- provides 10 random, very basic words and sentences; example: `Hello,こんにちは`
- gives no instructions on how to create the Anki deck (I didn't ask for it, but it's not as proactive as Gemini and DeepSeek)
### Do you understand Markdown and XML? Can I give you advanced prompts using Markdown and XML?
Yes, I understand both Markdown and XML, and you're welcome to use them in your advanced prompts. Feel free to provide any instructions or content in these formats, and I'll do my best to work with them!

## Attempts
### Attempt \#1
Same input query as the last input query of Gemini.
- Not a bad start, produced a nice table with proper sentence structure.
- A nitpick: the hints are not really hints, and are not funny, either.
- Again, it gives me the "corrected sentences". I don't want that.
- If I plug in the ChatGPT-reasoning suggested answer, it gives it B-. Hmm.
- It is really fixating on "the most natural sentence", ignoring the fact that I'm a beginner.
- Really likes typing in bold Markdown.
- When providing second sentence, the game continues. That's good, but the output is garbage. Time to improve the prompt.
