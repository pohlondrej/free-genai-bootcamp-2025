Yes! Let's play! 🎌😃
Give me your first English sentence, and I'll prepare the vocabulary and structure for you.

// INPUT: I wake up at 7AM every day. After I wake up, I drink coffee.

Here is your vocabulary table:  

| English          | ひらがな       | Japanese          |  
|----------------|------------|----------------|  
| I / me        | わたし       | 私             |  
| wake up       | おきる       | 起きる         |  
| 7 AM         | しちじ       | ７時           |  
| every day     | まいにち     | 毎日           |  
| after        | あと        | 後             |  
| drink        | のむ        | 飲む           |  
| coffee       | コーヒー     | コーヒー       |  

### Sentence Structure:  
1️⃣ **[Subject] [Time] [Verb]**  
2️⃣ **[After-Clause], [Subject] [Object] [Verb]**  

### Hints:  
☕ 1. Japanese loves time words early in the sentence, like a morning bird 🐦.  
☕ 2. "After" is like glue; it sticks two ideas together!  

Now, give it a try! 😆

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます. 起きるの後, コーヒーを飲みます.

Good attempt! Here’s your grade: **C+** 🎌⭐  

### Feedback:  
✅ **Great job using 時 for time and marking コーヒー as an object!**  
✅ **You understood the "After" structure idea!**  
❌ **午前 (ごぜん) is correct but optional in most casual sentences. Since 7 AM is obvious from the context, you don’t always need it!**  
❌ **"起きるの後" is unnatural! Japanese prefers "verb in て-form + から" for "after doing something."**  

### Corrected Sentences:  
**私は毎日七時に起きます。起きてから、コーヒーを飲みます。**  

### Hints for improvement:  
☕ **の後 is jealous! It only wants to be with nouns, not verbs. Try て-form + から instead!**  
☕ **午前 isn’t wrong, but Japanese people rarely say it unless the context is unclear.**  

Try again with these hints! 😆🎌

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます。起きた後で、コーヒーを飲みます。

You're getting closer! Your grade this time: **B-** ⭐🎌  

### Feedback:  
✅ **Great job fixing "の後" to "後で"—much better!**  
✅ **Your sentence is understandable!**  
❌ **"起きた後で" is grammatically correct, but Japanese prefers "て-form + から" for sequencing actions.**  
❌ **後で is usually used for actions that happen *later* rather than immediately after.**  

### Best Natural Sentence:  
**私は毎日七時に起きます。起きてから、コーヒーを飲みます。**  

### Hints:  
☕ **後で is like a slow train 🚃—it implies "later." "てから" is a bullet train 🚄—it means "right after!"**  
☕ **Your sentence is good, but "起きてから" would sound more natural in daily conversation!**  

Give it one last shot! 😆🔥

// INPUT: 私は毎日七時に起きます。起きてから、コーヒーを飲みます。

🎉 **A+! Perfect!** 🎉  

👏 **Great job! This is exactly how a native speaker would say it.**  

### Final Sentence:  
✅ **私は毎日七時に起きます。起きてから、コーヒーを飲みます。**  

🔥 **You mastered "てから" and natural sentence flow! Keep going!**

// INPUT: This plane is small, isn't it?

Here is your vocabulary table:  

| English      | ひらがな   | Japanese   |  
|-------------|----------|-----------|  
| this        | この      | この       |  
| plane       | ひこうき  | 飛行機     |  
| small       | ちいさい  | 小さい     |  
| isn't it?   | ね       | ね         |  

### Sentence Structure:  
**[This] [Object] [Adjective] [ね]**  

### Hints:  
🛩️ 1. "This" is picky! It must stick **directly** to the noun it describes.  
🛩️ 2. Japanese adjectives don’t need a verb like "is"—they handle everything on their own!  

Now, give it a try! 😆
