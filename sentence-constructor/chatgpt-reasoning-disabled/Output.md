Yes! Let's play! 🎌😃  

Give me your first English sentence, and I'll prepare the vocabulary and structure for you.

// INPUT: I wake up at 7AM every day. After I wake up, I drink coffee.

Here is your vocabulary table:  

| English       | ひらがな       | Japanese        |  
|--------------|-------------|----------------|  
| wake up      | おきる       | 起きる         |  
| 7 AM         | しちじ       | 7時           |  
| every day    | まいにち     | 毎日           |  
| after        | あと         | 後            |  
| drink       | のむ        | 飲む           |  
| coffee       | コーヒー     | コーヒー       |  

### Sentence Structure:  
1️⃣ **[Subject] [Time] [Verb]**  
2️⃣ **[Time] [Subject] [Verb] [Object]**  

### Hints:  
☕ The coffee won’t drink itself, so don’t forget to add the right verb at the end!  
⏰ "7時" already includes "o’clock," so no need to say "AM" separately!  

Now, try forming the sentence! 😃

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます. 起きるの後, コーヒーを飲みます.

### Grade: **B** 🏆✨  
You're very close! Just a couple of small fixes!  

### Hints:  
1️⃣ **午前 (ごぜん) is not wrong**, but since "7時" is already clear in context, it's often left out unless you need to clarify AM vs. PM.  
2️⃣ **"起きるの後"** ❌ → There's a smoother way to say "after waking up." Try using **て-form** instead!  

You're doing great! Try again! 😃

// INPUT: 私は毎日七時に起きます。起きてから、コーヒーを飲みます。

### Grade: **A** 🌟🏅  

Perfect! 🎉 Your sentence is grammatically correct and sounds natural. Well done! 🙌

- **起きてから** is spot on! It means "after waking up" and fits perfectly here.  
- **七時** is simple and clear, no need for extra AM or 午前.  

Now you’re ready for the next round! Do you have another sentence for me? 😊

// INPUT: This plane is small, isn't it?

Here is your vocabulary table:  

| English       | ひらがな       | Japanese        |  
|--------------|-------------|----------------|  
| plane        | ひこうき     | 飛行機          |  
| small        | ちいさい     | 小さい          |  
| this         | これ         | これ            |  
| is           | です         | です            |  
| isn't it?    | 〜ね         | 〜ね            |  

### Sentence Structure:  
1️⃣ **[Subject] [Adjective] [Verb] [Question marker]**  

### Hints:  
✈️ You might want to point at the plane with a finger, or at least say "これ" for "this."  
😏 The question marker is like the Japanese "isn't it?" (You’re close already!).  

Take a shot! Let's see how you do! 😄

// INPUT: この飛行機は小さいですね

### Grade: **A+** 🎯✨  

You nailed it! 🙌  
- **この飛行機** is perfect for "this plane."  
- **小さいですね** is exactly how you’d ask "isn't it small?" in a polite, natural way.  

You’ve got a great handle on this! Want to do another round? 😎
