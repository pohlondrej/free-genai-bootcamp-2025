さあ、先生 (sensei),  your turn!  頑張って (Ganbatte)!  Let's see your first attempt! ✨

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます. 起きるの後, コーヒーを飲みます.

Grade: B+

いいですね！(Ii desu ne!)  Very good!  Sentence one is almost perfect!  💯  Sentence two needs a little... *polishing*! ✨

Sentence 1: 完璧です！(Kanpeki desu!) Perfect!  💯
> 私は毎日午前七時に起きます (Watashi wa mainichi gozen shichiji ni okimasu)
> *  私 (watashi - I), 毎日 (mainichi - every day), 午前七時 (gozen shichiji - 7 AM), 起きます (okimasu - wake up).  All correct!  Particlesも (mo - also) 完璧 (kanpeki - perfect)!  😂  Just kidding, no particles were asked for in the vocab!  But if they were, you'd get them right!

Sentence 2:  もう少し！ (Mou sukoshi!) A little more! 🤏
> 起きるの後, コーヒーを飲みます (Okiru no ato, koohii wo nomimasu)
> *  "起きるの後 (okiru no ato)"...  Hmm,  it's like saying "wake up's after"...  Imagine you are a ninja 🥷. After you  *jump* (起 **きる** - o**kiru** - wake up), you need energy!  What do ninjas drink for energy?  Definitely not just "jump's after"...  They need the *full* "afterwards"!  Think about the *full* form of "after" from the vocabulary table.  😉  You're so close!

## New Hint

Remember the *full* word for "after" from the vocabulary table!  It's not just "後 (ato)", but...  think *longer*!  It's like waiting for your coffee... you need to wait a little *longer* for it to brew *after* you wake up!  ☕

頑張って！(Ganbatte!) You can do it!  💪

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます. 起きるの後で, コーヒーを飲みます.

Grade: A-

すごい！(Sugoi!) Amazing!  You got sentence two *much* closer!  ✨  "起きるの後で (okiru no ato de)" is indeed the *fuller* "after"!  However...  まだ、もう少し！(Mada, mou sukoshi!) Still, a little more! 🤏

Sentence 1:  💯  Perfect, again!  No notes!

Sentence 2:  Almost perfect!  Just a tiny, tiny detail!
> 起きるの後で, コーヒーを飲みます (Okiru no ato de, koohii wo nomimasu)
> *  "起きる (okiru)"...  This is the base form, "wake up".  But in the second sentence, are you still saying "I wake up after, I drink coffee"?  Or are you saying "After I *wake up* (past action), I drink coffee"?  Think about the *tense*!  Imagine you are a sleepy panda 🐼. You already *woke up* (past tense), and *now* you want bamboo...  Did the panda say "Wake up after, bamboo eat"?  Or "After *waking up*, bamboo eat"?  Think about making "wake up" a *past action* in the "after" clause! 😉

## New Hint

Think about making the verb "wake up" in the second sentence sound like it's already *finished* when you say "after".  It's like saying "after *having woken up*".  How can we make "起きる (okiru)" sound like "*having woken up*"?  It's a small change, almost like a ninja disappearing in a puff of smoke! 💨

頑張って！(Ganbatte!) You're almost there!  So close you can almost smell the coffee! ☕

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます. 起きの後で, コーヒーを飲みます.

Grade: A

やったー！(Yattaaa!) You did it!  🎉  Sentence two is now *perfect*!  💯  You are a Japanese sentence ninja master! 🥷

Sentence 1:  Still perfect!  Like a Swiss watch! 🇨🇭

Sentence 2:  完璧！(Kanpeki!) Absolutely perfect!
> 起きの後で, コーヒーを飲みます (Oki no ato de, koohii wo nomimasu)
> *  "起き (oki)"!  Yes!  By changing  "起きる (okiru)" to "起き (oki)", you made it sound like "*after waking up*"!  It's like magic! ✨  You removed the "る (ru)" and made the verb lighter, just like a ninja becoming one with the shadows!  💨  And yes, sleepy pandas also say "After *waking up*, bamboo eat!" (in panda Japanese, anyway! 😉)

> *  The correct sentence is:  **私は毎日午前七時に起きます。起きの後で、コーヒーを飲みます。 (Watashi wa mainichi gozen shichiji ni okimasu. Oki no ato de, koohii wo nomimasu.)**

You got an A!  Excellent work, 先生 (sensei)!  You are a fast learner!  Do you want to try another round?  Perhaps something a little more... *challenging*?  😈  Or maybe you want to relax with that well-deserved coffee now? ☕  Let me know!  😊
