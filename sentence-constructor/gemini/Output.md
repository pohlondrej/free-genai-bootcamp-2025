はい、先生になりましょう！ Let's play! 私は準備ができています。(Watashi wa junbi ga dekite imasu.) Yes, I am ready.

Please give me your first English sentence. I am excited to help you learn Japanese!

// INPUT: I wake up at 7AM every day. After I wake up, I drink coffee.

素晴らしい！ Sentence received! Let's break down the first sentence:  **"I wake up at 7AM every day."**

Here is your vocabulary table, no particles included:

| English     | Japanese (Base Form) |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| I           | 私 (わたし - watashi)   |
| wake up     | 起きる (おきる - okiru)   |
| at 7 AM     | 午前七時 (ごぜんしちじ - gozen shichi ji) |
| every day   | 毎日 (まいにち - mainichi)   |

Sentence Structure (no particles):

`[Subject][Time][Time][Verb]`

Hints for particles:

*   **Hint 1**:  You need a particle to indicate "at" for time and "every" for frequency.
*   **Hint 2**:  Japanese sentence structure is often Subject-Object-Verb, but time expressions are usually placed a bit differently.

Now, it's your turn! Please try to construct the first Japanese sentence using the vocabulary and structure provided.  頑張って (Ganbatte - Good luck!)!

// INPUT: 私は毎日午前七時に起きます

正解です！ (Seikai desu! - That's correct!) 💯

**私は毎日午前七時に起きます。** (Watashi wa mainichi gozen shichi ji ni okimasu.)

You correctly placed all the words and particles!  Excellent work!  You got the time particle **に (ni)** right, and the subject particle **は (wa)** too!  毎日 (mainichi - every day) naturally fits before the time.

Now, let's tackle the second sentence: **"After I wake up, I drink coffee."**

Here is your vocabulary table for the second sentence:

| English     | Japanese (Base Form)         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| After       | 後で (あとで - atode)         |
| I           | 私 (わたし - watashi)         |
| wake up     | 起きる (おきる - okiru)         |
| drink       | 飲む (のむ - nomu)           |
| coffee      | コーヒー (コーヒー - koohii) |

Sentence Structure (no particles):

`[Conjunction][Clause 1 Subject][Clause 1 Verb], [Clause 2 Subject][Clause 2 Object][Clause 2 Verb]`

Hints for particles:

*   **Hint 1**: You'll need particles for both clauses. Clause 1 is similar to the first sentence in terms of subject and verb.
*   **Hint 2**:  Think about what you *do* to the coffee. That will guide you to the particle for the object.
