The tool execution failed with error: {error}

When a tool fails, consider these strategies:
1. For search_wikipedia:
   - Try a simpler search term (e.g. "crown" instead of "crown (royalty)")
   - If redirected, use the redirected page title
   - Make sure to use English terms only

2. For summarize_text:
   - Make sure you have valid Wikipedia text to summarize
   - Keep the summary concise but informative
   - Focus on the most important points

3. For translate_to_japanese:
   - Ensure the English text is clear and simple
   - Avoid complex technical terms
   - Keep sentences short

4. For extract_vocabulary:
   - Make sure you have Japanese text to extract from
   - Focus on common, useful words
   - Include all required fields (word, reading, romaji, meaning)

Remember:
1. Always include both "observation" and "thought" in your response
2. Follow the workflow steps in order
3. Never skip steps or go backwards
4. Never make up data
