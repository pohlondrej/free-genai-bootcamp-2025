# Action Plan

## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Exploration

*   Explore OPEA Project: Familiarize yourself with the OPEA project structure within the `GenAIComps` folder. Understand its components and how it's designed to work.
*   vLLM Setup: Set up vLLM in CPU mode. Ensure you can load a model and run basic inference.
*   Documentation: Create `docs/Learnings.md` to record all findings, challenges, and solutions encountered during the project.
*   Project Rules: Refer to `docs/Rules.md` for project constraints and guidelines.

### 2. Integration and Adaptation

*   Identify Integration Points: Determine how vLLM can be integrated into the OPEA project. Look for opportunities to replace or augment existing components with vLLM.
*   Docker Compose Configuration: Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to include a vLLM service. Configure it to run in CPU mode and mount the necessary model weights.
*   Adaptation: Adapt the OPEA project's services to use the vLLM service for inference. This might involve modifying API calls or data processing pipelines.

### 3. Deployment and Testing

*   Deploy MegaService: Deploy your adapted mega service using Docker Compose.
*   Testing: Thoroughly test the deployed service to ensure it's functioning correctly. Pay attention to performance and resource usage.
*   Iterate and Refine: Based on your testing results, iterate on your integration and deployment. Refine the Docker Compose configuration and adapt the OPEA project's services as needed.
