# Action Plan

## Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Exploration ðŸ”„

- [x] Study ChatQnA example in `GenAIExamples/`:
    - [.] Locate and document the project structure
    - [ ] Identify the model(s) used and their requirements
    - [ ] Map out the key components and their interactions
    - [ ] Document findings in `Learnings.md`
- [ ] Evaluate vLLM compatibility:
    - [ ] Check if original models can run with vLLM
    - [ ] Research alternative models if needed
    - [ ] Document model requirements and constraints

### 2. Integration and Adaptation

- [ ] Create vLLM service configuration:
    - [ ] Set up CPU-compatible container
    - [ ] Configure model weights mounting
    - [ ] Implement OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
- [ ] Adapt ChatQnA components:
    - [ ] Modify API calls to use vLLM service
    - [ ] Adjust configuration for CPU deployment

### 3. Deployment and Testing

- [ ] Deploy adapted service:
    - [ ] Test basic model loading
    - [ ] Verify API endpoints
    - [ ] Document any issues or learnings
- [ ] Iterate based on findings:
    - [ ] Optimize for CPU performance
    - [ ] Troubleshoot integration issues
    - [ ] Record all significant learnings
