# Working prompts
## Prompts for documentation generation:
#### For EACH API endpoint, generate example JSON string response so that it maps to the database schema. Hint: I don't want you to write code, just JSON responses.
- Worked fine, but left out last 6 JSON examples. Did it time out?
- Markdown formatting is not great.
##### Follow-up prompt: You missed a couple of JSON responses, can you complete them for these two endpoints?
- Worked fine.
