Please fix your response to match one of these formats:

Format for next action:
{
    "observation": "Your understanding of the current state",
    "thought": "Your reasoning about what to do next",
    "action": {
        "name": "tool_name",  // Must be EXACTLY one of: search_wikipedia, summarize_text, translate_to_japanese, extract_vocabulary
        "input": "tool_input"  // Must be a string matching the tool's expected input type
    }
}

Format for final answer:
{
    "observation": "Your understanding of the current state",
    "thought": "Your reasoning about why you are done",
    "final_answer": {
        "article": {
            "title": "Article title",
            "english": "Simplified English text",
            "japanese": "Japanese translation"
        },
        "vocabulary": [
            {"word": "日本", "reading": "にほん", "romaji": "nihon", "meaning": "Japan"}
        ]
    }
}

Remember:
1. For ambiguous topics, acknowledge the ambiguity and choose the most common meaning
2. Follow the workflow steps in EXACT order with EXACT tool names:
   - search_wikipedia -> input: English topic name
   - summarize_text -> input: English Wikipedia text  
   - translate_to_japanese -> input: Simplified English text
   - extract_vocabulary -> input: Japanese translated text
3. Never skip steps or go backwards
4. Never make up data
5. Always include both "observation" and "thought" fields
6. Action must be a dictionary with both "name" and "input" fields
